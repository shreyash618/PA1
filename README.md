This assignment explores various algorithms and heuristics to help PacMan explore the map and obtain it's objectives to win the game. Some of the algorithms we programmed were BFS, DFS, UCS, and AStar graph searching algorithms. We also utilized different heuristics to optimize Pacman's search, such as Manhattan and Maze Distances, depending on the problem PacMan was trying to solve. To understand how to run our Pacman problem, you should run "python pacman.py -h" to learn about the different layouts, search agents, and problems you can run.
